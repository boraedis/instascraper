I am a Prototyping Instructor (also known as PI) at the Flowers Invention Studio which is located in the manufacturing building and is open to all Tech students. I'm also part of Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I also just got involved as an undergraduate research assistant at the PoWeR lab. The best advice I can give is to really master the art of time management, that way you can really enjoy the whole experience at Tech. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me! Congratulations on your awesome achievement, and go jackets!24w"

2020-12-20T17:48:02.000Z,Jen O,engineering,,,BLANK,Industrial engineering,,"Hey everyone!  My name is Jen O'Brien and I'm a 3rd year Industrial engineering major with a minor in engineering and business. I'm currently president of the Ramblin' Reck Club (the spirit and traditions organization, and we take care of the Reck mascot!) and have held various positions in my social sorority Alpha Gamma Delta. I've also studied abroad and held a summer internship. My best advice is to embrace new opportunities especially spontaneous ones and to do things because they make you happy - not to just put it on your resume. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about anything I've mentioned!  Congrats and go jackets!24w"
